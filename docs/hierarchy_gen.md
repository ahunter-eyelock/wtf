# The Hierarchy Generator Pattern

As the name implies, the Hierarchy Generator Pattern (HGP) is a C++ pattern that generates class hierarchies similar to dependency injection. HGP combines various generic behavioral policy classes into a linerar inheratence model which eleminates problems caused by achieving a similar result with multiple inheritance.
